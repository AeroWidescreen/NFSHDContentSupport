## FAQ
Q: What does this do?  
A: It enables support for HD textures and videos by correcting their scaling through an ASI script. No textures or videos are included.  

Q: Can this work with HD Font Support?  
A: This plugin does exactly what HD Font Support used to do, but more. It's not needed.  

Q: Can I bundle this with my own mod?  
A: Yes, but I ask that you credit me as a courtesy.
